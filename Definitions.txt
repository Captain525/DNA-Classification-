Shotgun sequencing - single step sequencing process. Shear whole genome. Then each small fragment undergoes sequencing randomly. Remove overlapping sequencing. 
Scaffold - portion of genome sequence reconstructed from end-sequenced whole-genome shotgun clones. 
Composed of contigs and gaps

contigs - a contiguous length of genomic sequence in which order of bases known at high confidence level. Put together several little overlapping bits of dna into a longer sequence. 
Contigs don't have gaps. 
GaPS - reads from 2 sequenced ends of at least one fragment overlap with other reads in two different contigs.

Scaffold - chain contigs together, separate them with gaps (stuff we don't know). Needs info about relative position and orientation of contigs.
